# RENESAS-MCU-2020-Project

This is a team-work project!

Firstly we had to assembly the parts of an autonomous robot car, programming it and then optimize it,
in order to drive faster and be accurate as much as possible.
The microcontroller that is used is RX62T, a 32-bit microcontroller from Renesas Company, also the IDE was from Renesas.
The autonomous robot car used several sensors to detect the road, where based on the answers of these sensors the speed of the motors was controlled. 
Also an encoder was used to measure the speed of the car, so that the driving accuracy is as good as possible.
Problems during this project have been the drop in battery level. Therefore, it was necessary to provid all the possibilities that could have happened for the car to finish the given road in the fastest possible time.
